    * PodPhase describes the phase this task is in  Possible enum values:  - `\"Failed\"` means that all containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in a failure (exited with a non-zero exit code or was stopped by the system).  - `\"Pending\"` means the pod has been accepted by the system, but one or more of the containers has not been started. This includes time before being bound to a node, as well as time spent pulling images onto the host.  - `\"Running\"` means the pod has been bound to a node and all of the containers have been started. At least one container is still running or is in the process of being restarted.  - `\"Succeeded\"` means that all containers in the pod have voluntarily terminated with a container exit code of 0, and the system is not going to restart any of these containers.  - `\"Unknown\"` means that for some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.
